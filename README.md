AI-based Zero-Day Intrusion Detection System that monitors system activity, detects anomalies using machine learning, and automatically responds to potential cyber threats with alerts and blocking mechanisms.
An intelligent cybersecurity project that detects and prevents zero-day attacks using AI and automated response techniques.
This system monitors system behaviour such as CPU usage, login attempts, IP activity, and network traffic. Using anomaly detection, it identifies unusual patterns that may represent unknown cyber threats. When suspicious activity is detected, the system generates alerts, logs events, and blocks harmful actions to protect the system.
The project is designed as a hackathon prototype combining Python backend logic with a simple UI dashboard for monitoring and visualization.
